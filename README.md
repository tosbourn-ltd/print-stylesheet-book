# Print Stylesheet Book Website

To get this working locally you should just need to clone the repo
run `bundle install` then run `jekyll s` to start the server.

If you run into difficulties with this, you may need to grab the modified `jekyll-sitemap` gem. Just run `git clone git@github.com:tosbourn/jekyll-sitemap.git` in the same directory that your Print Stylesheet repo lives. 

If it all works the site should be available on localhost:4000
