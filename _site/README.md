# Print Stylesheet Book Website

To get this working locally you should just need to clone the repo,
run `bundle install`, then run `jekyll s` to start the server.

If you run into difficulties with this you may need to clone the modified repo for the jekyll-sitemap gem. To do this `git@github.com:tosbourn/jekyll-sitemap.git` into the same directory that your Print Stylesheets repo will sit.

If it all works the site should be available on `localhost:4000`
